"# OpenCV Hands-On" 
1. Setup & Image Loading

Robust image loading with both OpenCV and Pillow (handles cv2.imread returning None).

Safe display in Matplotlib with correct BGR↔RGB conversion.

Synthetic image generator (so exercises run even without external files).

2. Basic Operations

Image resizing, cropping, and rotation.

Affine and perspective transforms.

3. Drawing & Annotation

Drawing lines, rectangles, circles, and adding text overlays.

Creating synthetic images with annotations.

4. Color Spaces

Converting between RGB, BGR, HSV, and grayscale.

Channel splitting and visualization.

5. Filtering & Noise Reduction

Averaging blur, box blur, Gaussian blur, median blur, bilateral filtering.

Comparing filter effects on noisy images.

6. Thresholding & Morphology

Binary, Otsu, and adaptive thresholding.

Morphological operations: erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.

7. Edge Detection & Contours

Gradient-based edge detection (Sobel).

Canny edge detection.

Extracting and drawing contours.

8. Histogram Equalization

Contrast enhancement for grayscale images using cv2.equalizeHist.

9. Feature Detection

Harris and Shi–Tomasi (Good Features to Track).

Robust corner plotting.

HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) descriptor and visualization.

10. Template Matching

Detecting small patches inside a larger image using correlation.

11. Self-Learning Exercises

Edge extraction on complex images (chameleon example).

Filtering noisy grayscale images with multiple kernels.

Feature extraction with HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients).

Analysis and reflection questions included for each section.
